        "comment": "\"The product came with continuous software issues. The product was not damaged, and like all Apple products was packaged quite well. With that said, after booting it up I ran into non-stop issues. Everything from getting into my Apple ID Account, to getting my information transferred over. I spent most of my first day on the phone with Apple Care.\n\nAside from having that largest bezels, smallest battery (2,815mAh), slowest refresh rates (60Hz), and overpriced hardware, it looks nice and has a very fast processor! All things said, 5G is several years out and this phone is too.  For $800+ the Samsung S20FE or OnePlus 8 would be amazing alternatives.  Heck I would even buy the Pixel 5 over this.\n\nApple please listen to your customer base.  They don't want 5G or even better cameras. YOU'RE APPLE! This phone should have the smallest bezels, the largest battery, at least 8GB or RAM and 120Hz screen refresh like everyone else in the industry has been had for a year! Then you can charge $800 without a charger... lol\n\nCome on now!\""

        "comment": "This book describes entire software development lifecycle incredibly well. It equips the reader a framework of thinking from the point use case and requirements are given to the engineers until it is becomes a UML. The examples provided are vivid and on point. Concepts of each next chapter has continuity from the previous chapter, which gives the reader progressive feedback. ABCDFG method that covered in this book provides a formalized way to transform use case into classes, I really love it, it is directly applicable to my job and it is a gold imo. Even an experienced coders would reap aha moments during reading. Also, the fact that it is written in the valley provides a flavor of how software development is done at the epicenter of technology."

        "comment": "I got this book for my friend since she is interested in learning object-oriented programming and design. This book exposed her to different methodologies with clear descriptions and concrete examples and helpful graphics. Before reading this book, she had limited experience in OOAD and practical system modeling. This book did a good job comprehensively explaining analysis, design, UML, and design principles among other topics. In particular, the step-by-step design examples are very reader-friendly. For example, one case shows how to present code from use cases with UML graphs by applying the ABCDFG method. It also introduced her to different UML architecture diagrams, like layer, flow, and sequence diagrams. What she likes most about this book is the exercises section, which provides simple tests to let her know whether she really understands the concepts or not. She found it very easy to apply the methodologies from this book to her work."

The book is well-designed and flows naturally from chapter to chapter. It's a quick read from start to finish, but also contains sufficient detail on each subject to serve as a comprehensive reference.\n\nIn addition to being a strong writer, it is clear that the author has deep experience in software design. The OOAD Cookbook is an indispensable reference for any software designer, whether a beginner first learning the concepts in an academic setting, or an experienced software engineer looking to improve his or her craft.\""

        "comment": "\"This little robe is absolutely adorable and super soft. My baby loves to be snuggled up and cuddled and looks ridiculously cute in his little fox robe. Unfortunately it isn't the BEST quality, but isn't horribly made. For the price it is acceptable. So I won't give it less than 3 stars.\n\nMy main issues are the size of the robe and shrinkage of the material. The robe is VERY small. My baby is 3 months old and it is really short on him; nearly up to his baby butt cheeks already. He won't be able to use it until 9 months old for sure.\n\nThe fabric is very soft and fluffy. it will feel great on baby's delicate skin. Unfortunately it shrank with the first wash. A little shrinkage is expected, but it will shrink quite a bit, even when following laundering instructions.\n\nThis is a very soft and very cute robe. However, if you have a bigger baby, I would consider purchasing a larger robe. This robe will not fit your baby very long. For the money it isn't bad, but it definitely isn't the best.\""

        "comment": "This is NOT a sturdy cart. I have no idea why it is advertised as \"Amazon's Choice.\" Contrary to the advertisement and description, the steel is very light gauge and seems rather flimsy. I would hesitate to load it with much weight at all. It seems like it would break easily. The front wheels do not turn easily and the materials used in the construction of the cart are not strong. I was very disappointed when I assembled the cart. I would return it immediately but that is difficult since it is already assembled and the box it came in feel apart when we opened it. Everything about this cart is cheap and certainly not worth the extra dollars it cost. I'm really surprised about Amazon."

I upgraded the hard drive from the built in eMMC to an NVMe via the M2. slot (Kingston A2000, 250gb @$49.99, read=1300/write=1000 verified) and it makes this laptop very zippy to operate. I tested the built-in eMMC and it still gets a respectable 300mb read/200mb write speed, so if you don't want to upgrade it will still be fast enough. Don't expect to do things like gaming(unless you're thinking about something like Microsoft cloud gamepass for PC, launches in the spring). It will do great with everything else, from movies to excel , or any program that's not resource intensive nature. Overall I highly recommend this laptop and at this price it provides an abundance of value."
